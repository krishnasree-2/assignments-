# Responsive Personal Portfolio (HTML + CSS)

This repository contains a responsive personal portfolio page built with **only HTML and CSS** (no CSS frameworks). It satisfies the assignment requirements: header, hero, skills, footer, responsive breakpoints, and uses at least one AI tool to help scaffold the initial template.

## Files
- `index.html` — markup for the page
- `style.css` — all styles and responsive rules
-  screenshots of Desktop/Tablet/Mobile views can be added to the repo

## How it meets the requirements

### Sections included
- **Header**: logo/name, navigation links (Home, About, Skills, Contact)
- **Hero**: headline, short description, "Contact Me" button
- **Skills**: grid of at least 6 skills (8 provided)
- **Footer**: social links and contact card

### Responsiveness
- **Desktop (≥1024px)**: navigation links show in a row.
- **Tablet (768–1023px)**: hero text reflows and grid becomes 2 columns.
- **Mobile (≤767px)**:
  - CSS-only hamburger menu (checkbox + label)
  - Skills section becomes single column
  - No horizontal scrolling (body `overflow-x: hidden`)

### AI Tools used
- **AI tool used:** Replit AI — I used Replit AI to generate an initial HTML/CSS template scaffold.

### Manual edits (what I changed/fixed after AI scaffold)
- Reworked layout to use CSS Grid for hero and skills for fully responsive behavior.
- Implemented a **CSS-only hamburger** menu (checkbox hack) and improved accessibility attributes.
- Tuned typography, spacing, colors and added a subtle profile float animation.
- Added skill card hover effect and button styles.
- Ensured there is **no horizontal scroll** and fixed mobile layout flow.
- Added `README.md` and comments for assignment submission.
